        <h2>My Journey as a Computer Engineering Student</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently studying Computer Engineering. During my academic journey,
            I have learned programming fundamentals, web development, and basic machine
            learning concepts.

        <p>
            This blogging website is created using HTML and CSS as a static project.
            It helped me understand website structure, page linking, and layout design.
